		<h3>Directions</h3>
		1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
		flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
		temperature and let simmer.<br>
		2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
		lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
		that it does not run off. <br>
		3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
		degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
